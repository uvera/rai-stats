## What's vendored

Eight skills from BMAD-METHOD's planning shelf, plus the two shared scripts
they depend on:

- `core-skills/bmad-forge-idea`
- `core-skills/bmad-brainstorming`
- `core-skills/bmad-advanced-elicitation`
- `core-skills/bmad-deep-recon`
- `bmm-skills/plan/bmad-product-brief`
- `bmm-skills/plan/bmad-prfaq`
- `bmm-skills/plan/bmad-prd`
- `bmm-skills/plan/bmad-ux`
- `scripts/memlog.py`, `scripts/resolve_customization.py` (shared utilities
  every vendored skill calls, originally at `src/scripts/` in the source
  repo)

Upstream collapsed the four `bmm-skills` above out of numbered
`1-analysis/` and `2-plan-workflows/` directories into a single flat
`plan/` directory as of this vendor pass; their content is otherwise
unchanged. `bmad-deep-recon` is now included in a tagged release
(previously only on `main`), so this pass pins to the `v6.11.0` tag
instead of a `main` commit SHA.

`bmad-forge-idea` is new upstream as of this pass: a persona-driven
interrogation skill that pressure-tests an idea before any artifact gets
written, added ahead of `bmad-brainstorming` as the shelf's first step.
It carries its own script, `scripts/resolve_personas.py`, vendored
alongside it (not shared — only this skill calls it). Its upstream
counterpart `bmad-party-mode` (the multi-agent roster it can optionally
draw on) is not vendored, since a real roster needs BMAD's own
`bmm-skills/agents/bmad-agent-*` persona skills too — a parallel system
to Hedgehog's own `src/agents/`, out of scope here. `bmad-forge-idea`
degrades gracefully without it: `resolve_personas.py` returns an empty
roster and the skill falls back to generating personas on the fly, which
is its documented normal path, not a degraded one.

Each skill directory carries its own templates, reference files, and
scripts as vendored, unmodified except where noted below.

## What's stripped

BMAD-METHOD's own orchestration layer is not vendored and is removed from
every skill file that referenced it:

- Central config resolution (`_bmad/scripts/resolve_config.py`,
  `_bmad/config.toml`, `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml`) — replaced with trivial
  defaults inline in each skill.
- `bmad-party-mode` (multi-agent roster) mentions and invocations.
- Chain-forward "common next skill" suggestions and `bmad-help` routing.
- Misroute-detection logic pointing at non-vendored BMAD skills.

`{bmad-root}` is introduced as a convention across the vendored files,
meaning this directory (`vendor-skills/BMAD/`) — used to address the shared
scripts (`{bmad-root}/scripts/memlog.py`, etc.) without reaching outside
this vendored tree.

## Re-vendoring

Pinned deliberately. Re-vendoring against a newer BMAD-METHOD commit is a
manual act: repeat the fetch against the new ref, re-apply the strip step
above, and update this file's pinned commit and date.
